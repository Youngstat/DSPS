# RULES: DSPS 2019 midterm

You are allowed to consult any resource except for live-interacting people

You are welcome to ask questions to me and Alex (the instructor) at any time. Do so discretely by raising your hand or coming to us.

You are allowed to leave the room, but please leave your technology (phone and laptop etc) behind 

READ all of the instructions carefully! I promise this will help you!

You can use the hints that are linked to the instructions as you wish (also allowed to ignore them and come up with different ways to get the solution!) - you will not be penalized for using hints

You are allowed to use the shortcuts and partial solutions. If you go back and do the steps that lead to the partial solutions you will get points for those steps, even if they are performed after you performed later tasks

Upload your notebook on UD Canvas (assignment will be open momentarily)

Your grade is compiled based on the notebook as it is rendered. Your notebook should run on Colab. If it does not you will get 10% fewer points. If it does not because you went back to some tasks indicate so in the notebook. However, starting with the tasks that use the partial solutions forward your notebook needs to run.

Remember figure captions, axis labels, stating significant thresholds before the analysis is performed, comment on strengths and weaknesses of the analysis

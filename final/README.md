# RULES: DSPS 2019 final

1. You are allowed to consult any resource except for live-interacting people

2. You are welcome to ask questions to me and at any time. Do so on [slack using the #final channel](https://dspsud2019.slack.com/archives/CPK314HLK). You can also direct message me on slack, but using the #final channel is the preferred method. Most likely if you direct message me I will ask you to repeat the quyestion in #final.

3. READ all of the instructions carefully! I promise this will help you!

4. You can use the hints that are linked to the instructions as you wish (also allowed to ignore them and come up with different ways to get the solution!) - you will not be penalized for using hints

5. You are allowed to use the shortcuts and partial solutions. If you go back and do the steps that lead to the partial solutions you will get points for those steps, even if they are performed after you performed later tasks

6. **DO NOT UPLOAD THE FINAL ON GITHUB!** upload to this assignment by uploading a jupyter notebook to the Canvas final assignment. If you create the notebook on colab make sure you are able to download the notebook in time (especially if you had issues with this for the midterm) and uploading it to this assignment. You are allowed multiple submissions so feel free to upload partial solutions throughout (to be sure you have something uploaded by the deadline!) but it is your responsibility to make sure the versions are clearly labelled so that I know which one I should grade.

7. Your grade is compiled based on the notebook as it is rendered. Your notebook should run on Colab. If it does not you will get 10% fewer points. If it does not because you went back to some tasks indicate so in the notebook. However, starting with the tasks that use the partial solutions forward your notebook needs to run.

8. Remember **figure captions**, **axis labels**, **stating significant thresholds before the analysis is performed**, **comment on strengths and weaknesses of the analysis**

# RULES: DSPS 2019 final

1.  **DO NOT UPLOAD THE FINAL ON GITHUB!** upload to this assignment by uploading a jupyter notebook to the Canvas final assignment. If you create the notebook on colab make sure you are able to download the notebook in time (especially if you had issues with this for the midterm) and uploading it to this assignment. You are allowed multiple submissions so feel free to upload partial solutions throughout (to be sure you have something uploaded by the deadline!) but it is your responsibility to make sure the versions are clearly labelled so that I know which one I should grade.

2. You are welcome to ask questions to me at any time. Do so on [slack using the #final channel](https://dspsud2019.slack.com/archives/CPK314HLK). You can also direct message me on slack, but using the #final channel is the preferred method. Most likely if you direct message me I will ask you to repeat the question in #final.

3. You are allowed to consult any resource except for live-interacting people

4. READ all of the instructions carefully! I promise this will help you!

5. You can use the hints that are linked to the instructions as you wish (also allowed to ignore them and come up with different ways to get the solution!) - you will not be penalized for using hints

6. You are allowed to use the shortcuts and partial solutions. If you go back and do the steps that lead to the partial solutions you will get points for those steps, even if they are performed after you performed later tasks
 

7. Your grade is compiled based on the notebook as it is rendered and specifically on the requested deliverables and on the comments you make in plot captions and text cells. *Plots without captions or axis labels do not count.* Your notebook should run on Colab. If it does not you will get 15% fewer points. If any task is partially completed and that stops the notebook from running indicate so in the notebook. However, if I bypass that cell of code and move along with the tasks that used the partial solutions  your notebook needs to run.

8. Remember **figure captions**, **axis labels**, **stating significant thresholds before analysis where applicable**, **comment on strengths and weaknesses of the analysis**

9. If you find any mistakes or inaccuracies in the instructions please contact me promptly! so that I can correct them! you will get 1 point added to your score.

## Higgs Boson 

- Download the Higgs boson data from Kaggle (programmatically within the notebook)

- Split the provided training data into a training and a test set. For each model calculate and discuss the training and test score results.

- Use a Random Forest and a Gradiend Boosted Tree Classifier model to predict the label of the particles.

- Produce a confusion matrix for each model and compare them

- Use a Random Forest and a Gradiend Boosted Tree Regressor model to predict the weight of the particles.

- Calculate the L1 and L2 metrics of each model and compare them.

- For the Random Forest classifier, explore the parameter space with the sklearn module sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV

- Generate an ROC curve plot and discuss it

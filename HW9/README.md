## Higgs Boson 

1 Download the Higgs boson data from Kaggle (programmatically within the notebook)

2 Split the provided training data into a training and a test set. For each model calculate and discuss the t training and test score results.

3 Use a Random Forest and a Gradiend Boosted Tree Classifier model to predict the label of the particles.

4 Produce a confusion matrix for each model and compare them

5 Use a Random Forest and a Gradiend Boosted Tree Regressor model to predict the weight of the particles.
 
6 Calculate the L1 and L2 metrics of each model and compare them.

7 For the Random Forest classifier, explore the parameter space with the sklearn module sklearn.model_selection.RandomizedSearchCV

8 Generate an ROC curve plot and discuss it

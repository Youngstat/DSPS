# HW5

# READING: 
Read about [rentologic](https://rentlogic.com/faq): a perfect example of data science applied to urban problems. 

Work in groups of 3 to 5 people. 

Remember to include a README.md, in markdown format, that states how your team worked: who you worked with and what you contributed specifically.

# 1. sampling

Finish the lab started in class.  The lab is uploaded in [lab3](https://github.com/fedhere/DSPS/blob/master/lab5/labPI_inclass.ipynb) both a copy of the notebook worked in class and a slighty more refined one I prepared.


# 2. reidentifying urban information

The goal is to identify individual building owners that may violate energy regulations by merging urban datasets. Follow instructions in https://github.com/fedhere/DSPS/blob/master/HW5/BuildingsEnergyOwners.ipynb
